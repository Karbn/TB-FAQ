## DO

* Keep your css in the supplied `<style scoped></style>` tags
* Keep your js in the supplied `<script type="text/javascript"></script>` tags
* Use `<p></p>` tags to represent text
* Use <span></span> tags to style certain text within paragraphs
* Use JQuery over JS wherever appropriate
* Name your files `like_this.html` (underscores and lower case)

## DO NOT

* Use meaningless tags, i.e using `<div></div>` tags to represent text as well as ten other things
* Stray too far from common layout
* Inline your css or JS unless absolutely necessary
* Make your JS annoying or obtrusive (for example never use `alert()` and expect me to merge it)
