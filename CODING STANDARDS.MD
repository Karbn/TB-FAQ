## DO

### HTML
* Use meaningful tags (`<p></p>` tags to represent a paragraph for example)
* Name your files `like_this.html` (underscores and lower case)

### CSS:
* You usually won't need to supply any of your own css
* Keep your own css in the supplied `<style></style>` tags
* DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ADD GENERIC STYLING SUCH AS `p { ... }` AS THIS WILL CAUSE THE WHOLE PAGE TO CHANGE - USE CLASSES INSTEAD
* Name your classes in the form `faq_classNameHere`

### JS:
* Keep your js in the supplied `<script type="text/javascript"></script>` tags
* Use JQuery over JS wherever appropriate


## DO NOT

### HTML
* Use meaningless tags, i.e using `<div></div>` tags to represent text as well as ten other things
* Stray too far from common layout

### CSS
* Attempt to use generic selectors
* Style the page wildly differently to the rest of the pages

### JS
* Inline your css or JS unless absolutely necessary
* Make your JS annoying or obtrusive (for example never use `alert()` and expect me to merge it)
