					<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> What can I report for?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> You can report anything that is rule breaking, insulting or illegal. Take a look at the board's rules thread and <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/showthread.php?t=331097">the general forum rules.</a> Before you submit a report, to be sure that it really is <b>rule breaking.</b></p> 
                    <br/><br/>
                  
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Where do i report?</p>
					<p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> To know where you have to report your issue please refer to <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/announcement.php?f=712">this.</a></p>
                    <br/><br/>                  
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> Can I Report for XYZ?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> The things you should not report are:
                    <ul>
                    <li>- Spelling errors. Annoying, but not against the rules.</li>
                    <li>- Stupidity. Again, annoying, but not against the rules. If someone is being stupid, the best response is usually to just ignore it.</li>
                    <li>- Small generally not particularly offensive things, such as saying "ass" in a post.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I report a post?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> Under every post on the bottom left corner is a button that looks like 
                    <img src="http://cache.toribash.com/forum/images/ca_morpheus_gray/buttons/report.gif"> .
                    <p>This button is towards the top right for private messages. Click the button, follow the directions.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><b>Make Sure Your Report Is Intelligible:</b></p>
                    <p>THIS IS IMPORTANT! Mods need to be able to read and understand the problem.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>It may take a while for mods to take action, and all reports get sent to the <span class="faq_smod">Super Moderators</span>. Remember to include all relevant details in the report. Abusing the report feature can result in infractions or bans.</p>
                    <br/><br/>
			<p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> How do I report something from ingame?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> It is slightly more complicated to report any rule breaking that happened in the game.</p>
                    <p> To report something from ingame, you (almost) always need to screenshot the offense. Then upload the picture to some image hosting website. But <a href="http://imgur.com/">Imgur</a> is recommended.</p>
                    <p><b>Before Reporting, <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/announcement.php?f=712">READ THE STICKIES.</a></p></b>
                    <br/>
                    <p><b> Keep these things in mind, when you want to report something that happened ingame.</p>
                    <p>Once you have uploaded it to an image hosting website, link it to a <span class="faq_smod">Super Moderator</span> in a PM or create a thread about it in the <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=712">General Reports board.</a></b>
                    <p> While flaming is an offense, is it really worth reporting someone if they called you a buttface? </p>
                    <p> DO NOT REPORT WITHOUT EVIDENCE. The mods won't ban people just because you ask them to.</p>
                    <p> When reporting, try to keep it readable. This saves the <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/showgroups.php">Super Moderators</a> (<span class="faq_smod">Blue</span> name) a lot of time and effort when helping you. Check your PMs regularly to see if they replied.</p>
                    <p><a href="http://forum.toribash.com/showthread.php?t=148325">Again, make sure they're actually breaking a rule with their behavior.</a></p>

                    <p class="faq_question"><span class="faq_q">Q:</span> I got scammed!! What do I do?</p>
                    <p class="faq_answer"><span class="faq_a">A:</span> The <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/forumdisplay.php?f=518">Scam Reports</a> board is the best place to report a scam, and failure to report it in Scam Reports may result in your report being delayed for several days, if not completely forgotten about.</p>
                    <p><b>Before Reporting, <a href="http://forum.toribash.com/announcement.php?a=1070">READ THE STICKIES.</a></p></b>
                    <p>Failure to do so will result in your report being delayed for several days, if not completely forgotten about.</p>
