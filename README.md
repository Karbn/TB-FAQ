## Step-by-step guide

### 1. Make a GitHub account if you don't have one

To use this site, you must be registered. Accounts are completely free.

### 2. Contact Fear in IRC or on the forum to become part of the FAQ Org here on GitHub

Find me wherever is most accessable to you. I'm online at least daily so I'll catch your message quickly enough. On here, my username is 'Novaras'.

### 3. Read up on GitHub workflow

To work with GitHub, understanding the workflow is essential. It's actually pretty simple and seamless once you get used to it.
1. Make a branch (this is like a copy of all the files we have here)
2. Make edits to files in your branch (will be commited to your branch when you save)
3. After you've made the edits you want to, make a Pull Request
4. When I get around to it, I'll review and then merge your changes into the master branch (the one that will be used for the live faq.php items) if I'm happy with them

You can read a much clearer and in-depth tutorial [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#branch).
